# About the project

The input validation is only on the password input and is just here to update the style of an element of the page. The validation in this project isn't something you'll put inside a real project, cause here I only validate a string length and in reality there a lot more things to validate.

Idea comes from: https://www.instagram.com/p/C1MeXIWuni_/

# What I did with it?

I just make a login form inspired by the link above, by using HTML and CSS.
